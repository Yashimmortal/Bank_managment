Bank Management System

Overview

This project implements a Bank Management System in Python, offering core banking functionalities. The system has two variations:
1.Command-line Interface (CLI) implementation in bank_management.py.
2.Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation using Streamlit in app.py.
Both implementations manage banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, user updates, and account deletion.
